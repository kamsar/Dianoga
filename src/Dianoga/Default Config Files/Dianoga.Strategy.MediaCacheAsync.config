<!--
	Sets up Dianoga to act as a replacement media cache, which optimizes images on their way to the cache
	
	This is advantageous because it does not slow down the page load time of a visitor who is the first visitor
	(they will get unoptimized images, however). It is not advantageous if you are planning to use a CDN where
	it needs the optimized image the first time.
